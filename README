This clothing pack is designed to customize your Minecraft avatar. The templates for each item are available if the current selection of colors do not suit you.

You can use an image editor such as gimp, paint.net, or photoshop to assemble your outfit; however, it is recommended to use SkinEdit to do so.

A base skin is also included if you would rather build one from the ground up.
